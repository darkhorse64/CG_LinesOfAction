          <p>The game is played on a 8x8 board with two players. Each player has 12 checkers.</p>
          <p>The initial position of checkers is shown in the following picture:</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;"><img src=https://github.com/darkhorse64/CG_LinesOfAction/raw/main/config/board.png" alt="Img: LOA initial position" style="height: 350px; width: auto;"></img></p>
          <p>The goal of the game is to bring all of your own checkers together into a single connected group. Checkers can be connected vertically, horizontally or diagonally.</p>
          <strong>How to play: </strong>
          <p></p>
          <p>Black starts the game. Checkers move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>A checker moves exactly as many spaces as there are checkers (both friendly and opponent) on the line in which it is moving.</li>
              <li>A checker may not jump over an opponent checker.</li>
              <li>A checker may jump over friendly checkers.</li>
              <li>A checker may land on an empty square or a square occupied by an opponent checker, resulting in the latter's capture and removal from the game.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The game ends when one player has connected all his checkers or when <const>150</const> moves have been performed without victory from any player. In that case, the game is a draw.</p>
          <strong>Ending a turn: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A bot must output the coordinates of the piece he wants to move followed by its destination coordinates. Coordinates are expressed in chess notation e.g. "<const>e2e3</const>"</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Wrong output: </strong><br>
          <ul>
              <li>If the starting or destination coordinates are outside of the board,</li>
              <li>If the starting square is occupied by an opponent checker,</li>
              <li>If the destination square is occupied by an own checker,</li>
              <li>If the checker path is blocked by one or more opponent checkers,</li>
              <li>If the checker does not move exactly as many spaces as there are checkers (both friendly and opponent) on the line in which it is moving,</li>
          </ul>
          <p>the game will end and the other player will win.</p>

      <li>If your last move connects simultaneously your checkers and the opponent checkers, it is considered as a win for you.</li>
